A few weeks ago I joined [Automile](http://automile.io/), a Swedish startup based in Stockholm and established in early 2013. Originally founded by [Jens Nylander](https://twitter.com/nylanderjens) (founder of [Jens of Sweden](http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jens_of_Sweden) and [JAYS](http://www.jays.se/)) and co-founded by [Jacob Pontén](https://twitter.com/ponten), [Felix Rosén](https://twitter.com/felix_rosen) and [Hervé Soursou](https://twitter.com/hsoursou). I’ll be working with a great team of car enthusiast developers and designers living in the Internet of Things. Automile is aiming to build the best platform to connect you, vehicle driver and owner, with your vehicle data.

### About Automile

Automile comes in two shapes, a free version and a pro version.

[**Automile PRO**](http://automile.io/pro/) is an electronic vehicle trip logger with insight analytics that gives business owners all the tools to manage their fleet while saving money from day one and ensuring tax compliance. Available in 53 countries.

[**Automile FREE**](http://automile.io/free/) is the solution to help car drivers and owners manage their car and driving data simply and securely, all in one place, while earning personalized and useful rewards.

I’m looking forward to be a part of this team over many years to come and developing the best smart car solution out there.
