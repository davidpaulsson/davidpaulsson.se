With an approach that is always design-driven, I create user-friendly, robust design systems for websites and mobile-native apps.

I am currently working at [Hem](https://www.hem.com/)—a Stockholm-based independent design brand creating a new generation of furniture, accessories and lighting. Before Hem, I helped bring positive impact to the lives of children and youths through sports at [Heja](https://heja.io/), played a part shaping the GPS vehicle fleet tracking world at [Automile](https://automile.com/) and worked with various clients such as Sveriges Radio, TV4, GE, and ABB at [Valtech](https://www.valtech.com/sv-se/) and [ByBrick](https://www.bybrick.se/).

Besides work, I'm running a boutique shop [House of Paulsson](https://houseofpaulsson.se/) together with my wife and two kids, where we sell details for your plants, cuttings, and leaves. Despite my current position, I'm am always curious about new challenges through collaborations and freelance opportunities. Reach out at <david@davidpaulsson.se>
