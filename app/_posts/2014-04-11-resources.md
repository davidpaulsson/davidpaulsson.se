This will be updated regularly.

### CSS frameworks

I’m not really a fan of opinionated CSS frameworks like [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/). That being said, I do like some boilerplate code, as long as it doesn’t make any design decisions for me.
